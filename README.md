# httyd-bots  

A bunch of HTTYD-themed bots for IRC.  

## Cloudjumper  
Out of all of them, this is my favorite.  
Inspired from [Tmplt's Toothless](https://github.com/Tmplt/Toothless), it has all the same functionality and more.  
For a more inside look at its commands, look at Cloudjumper/README.rst  

## Thornado
A very simple bot, which sadly relies on threading.
It can monitor certain subreddits, and post whatever is new to an IRC channel.
For a more inside look at its commands, look at Thornado/README.rst
